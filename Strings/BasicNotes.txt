 String is the type of object that can store a sequence of characters enclosed by double quotes and every character is stored in 16 bits, i.e., using UTF 16-bit encoding

 A string acts the same as an array of characters.

 To make Java more memory efficient (because no new objects are created if it exists already in the string constant pool).

 if we use new keyword - In such a case, JVM will create a new string object in normal (non-pool) heap memory and the literal "Welcome" will be placed in the string constant pool. The variable s will refer to the object in the heap (non-pool)

 # Storage of Strings
 - String literal
    Whenever a String Object is created as a literal, the object will be created in the String constant pool. This allows JVM to optimize the initialization of String literal. The string constant pool is present in the heap.
 - The string can also be declared using a new operator i.e. dynamically allocated. In case of String are dynamically allocated they are assigned a new memory location in the heap . This string will not be added to the String constant pool.
 - By the use of the 'new' keyword, The JVM will create a new string object in the normal heap area even if the same string object is present in the string pool. 

 #Benefits of Immutability:
 - Strings are stored in a String Pool, allowing reuse of objects and reducing memory overhead.
 - Multiple threads can safely share the same string object without synchronization.
 - Immutable strings have a consistent hash code, making them reliable for use in collections like HashMap.


String is a predefined final class in Java present in java.lang package. It provides various methods to create, manipulate, and compare strings, like length(), charAt(), concat(), equals(), etc.
