# Collections Framework
* The Java Collection Framework is a set of classes and interfaces that provide a standardized way to store, retrieve, and manipulate groups of objects. It is part of the java.util package and includes several data structures, algorithms, and utilities.

## Key Concepts


### 1. Collection: A group of objects referred to as elements.



  * **Interfaces**: Define the behavior of collections (e.g., List, Set, Queue, Map).

* **Classes**: Provide implementations for the interfaces (e.g., ArrayList, HashSet, LinkedList, HashMap).



### 2. Core Interfaces:



* **List**: Ordered collection of elements (allows duplicates).

* **Set**: Unordered collection (does not allow duplicates).

* **Queue**: Ordered collection for processing elements in a specific order (FIFO or LIFO).

* **Map**: Collection of key-value pairs.



### 3. Key Implementations:



* **ArrayList**: Resizable array implementation of the List interface.

* **LinkedList**: Doubly linked list implementation of the List and Queue interfaces.

* **HashSet**: Implementation of the Set interface backed by a hash table.

* **HashMap**: Implementation of the Map interface for key-value pairs.



### 4. Advantages of the Collection Framework:



* Reduces programming effort.

* Improves code quality and reusability.

* Provides standard methods for data manipulation.

* Supports algorithms like sorting, searching, and filtering.

 ## Collections Class
 * Collections class in Java is one of the utility classes in the Java Collections Framework. The java.util package contains the Collections class in Java. The Java Collections class is used with the static methods that operate on the collections or return the collection
