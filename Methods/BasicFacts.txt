Different Ways to Create Java Method
There are two ways to create a method in Java:

1. Instance Method: Access the instance data using the object name. Declared inside a class.

Example:


// Instance Method
void method_name() {
    // instance method body
}
2. Static Method: Access the static data using class name. Declared inside class with static keyword.

Example:


// Static Method
static void method_name() {
    // static method body
}


Method Signature
It consists of the method name and a parameter list.

Number of parameters
Type of the parameters
Order of the parameters
Note: The return type and exceptions are not considered as part of it.

Method Signature of the above function:

 max(int x, int y) Number of parameters is 2, Type of parameter is int.

NAMING A METHOD: camelCase 


STATIC vs Instance Methods
 - STATIC 
   -- A static method belongs to the class rather than any specific object.
   -- Can be called without creating an instance of the class.
   -- Since static methods are not object-specific, they can access only static members (data and methods), and cannot access non-static members.
  
  - Instance Methods:
   -- An Instance method belongs to an object.

        -- Need to create an instance of the class to call.
        -- Can access instance variables, other instance methods, and static members of the class.
        -- Have access to this reference, which points to the current object.

ACCESS MODIFIERS
 - Private Access Modifier
    -- The private access modifier is specified using the keyword private. The methods or data members declared as private are accessible only within the class in which they are declared.
 - Default Access Modifier
    -- When no access modifier is specified for a class, method, or data member, it is said to have the default access modifier by default. This means only classes within the same package can access it.
 - Protected Access Modifier
    -- The protected access modifier is specified using the keyword protected. The methods or data members declared as protected are accessible within the same package or subclasses in different packages.
 - Public Access Modifier
    -- The public access modifier is specified using the keyword public. Public members are accessible from everywhere in the program. There is no restriction on the scope of public data members.
