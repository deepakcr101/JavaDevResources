# ☕ My Java Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Java Learning Journey** repository!  
This repo contains all the code, notes, and comments I’ve written while learning Java — from the basics to more advanced topics.  
It’s organized into folders based on different concepts, so you can follow along step-by-step.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Currently, the repository is structured into the following folders:

# Java Learning Journey


```text
Java-Learning-Journey/
├── basics-java/    # Core fundamentals of Java (variables, data types, operators, control flow), Guess the Number Game
├── methods/        # Defining and using methods, return types, method overloading
├── arrays/         # Array usage, looping through arrays, multidimensional arrays, Tic Tac Toe Game
├── strings/        # String operations, methods, StringBuffer, StringBuilder and best practices
├── oops/           # Basic OOP concepts,encapsulation,inheritance,abstraction,polymorphism,constructors,packages,interfaces etc.
├── exceptionHandling #ExceptionHandling,throw and throws,finally,custom exceptions,showcasing different types of exceptions etc.
└── README.md       # You are here :)



(More folders will be added as I progress in my Java learning!)

## 🧠 What's Inside Each Folder?

Each folder contains:
- **Java code examples** with proper comments explaining logic
- **Learning notes** in comment blocks inside each file
- **Small exercises** to practice the concepts
- Real-world analogies where possible

For example:
- In `basics-java/` you'll find examples on variables, operators, loops, and conditional statements.
- In `methods/` you'll see how to create reusable blocks of code and understand method parameters & returns.
- In `arrays/` you'll explore different types of arrays and how to process them.
- In `strings/` you'll work with text data and learn string manipulation techniques.
